# ArchLinux Hardened

âš  WORK IN PROGRESS âš 

This repository contains my ArchLinux setup which focuses on desktop security.

Beside security, my setup also aims to use all the bleeding edge and most advanced software we currently have, most notably:

- Btrfs : [copy-on-write](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write) filesystem with snapshot support
- Wayland : because X11 is old, slow, and insecure
- NFTables : because firewalling with iptables syntax sucks

Because of its hardened nature, you might have to get your hands dirty to get things to work.
Therefore this setup is not recommended if you don't have good GNU/Linux knowledge already.

## Highlights

- Secure boot
- Hardened kernel and LTS fallback
- Full disk encryption using LUKS 2
- AppArmor
- Auditd notifications
- Many systemd services helping you managing your system and keeping it secure

## FAQ

TODO

- How many passwords will I have to remember ?
- It doesn't seem to work in my VM, how can I make it work ?
- Pacman/Yay doesn't want me to install packages, wtf ?
- Help! My PC won't boot anymore!
- How can I expose internal service to the outside world ? (SSH server, HTTP server, etc.)
- Application XYZ doesn't work, AppArmor says it's denied, what do I do ?
- I need to set an environment variable globally, how do I do that ?

## Installation

In order to have a proper secure boot, you will have to install your own keys in the BIOS firmware.
By default, almost all computers are shipped with Microsoft's keys. This is to ensure out of the box
secure boot on Windows. Note that [Microsoft offers a service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/dashboard/file-signing-manage)
that allows anyone to sign a UEFI firmware. So basically if you decide to use Microsoft's keys,
anyone who manages to get its UEFI firmware signed will be able to bypass your secure boot.
I don't want that. And I don't trust Microsoft. So I decided so enroll my own keys instead.

âš   Replacing Microsoft's keys will probably break your Windows boot if you have one, in any case, [backing up those keys](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface/Secure_Boot#Backing_up_current_variables) won't hurt.

- Set an admin password to restrict the access to your BIOS settings
- Disable temporarly the secure boot in your BIOS settings
- Remove all the cryptographic keys from it and enter the "setup mode" (some BIOS won't let you enter the setup mode if the SB is not enabled, it's fine it will implicitly disable it)
- Download and boot into the [ArchLinux ISO](https://archlinux.org/download/).

Let's go!

```sh
$ pacman -S git
$ git clone https://github.com/ShellCode33/ArchLinux-Hardened
$ cd ArchLinux-Hardened
$ ./install.sh
```

If you get gpg/keyring related errors, do the following :

```sh
$ killall gpg-agent
$ rm -rf /etc/pacman.d/gnupg # might say resource is busy, it's ok
$ pacman-key --init
$ pacman-key --populate
$ pacman -Sy archlinux-keyring
```

Once the installation is finished, reboot your computer and log into your freshly installed OS.

You must now make sure the secure boot is setup properly. Many things could go wrong with it.

The install script automatically tries to insert secure boot keys into your BIOS.

To make sure they are there, run:

```
$ sudo sbkeysync --verbose
```

You should see something like this:

```
Filesystem keystore:
  /etc/secureboot/keys/db/db.auth [3337 bytes]
  /etc/secureboot/keys/KEK/KEK.auth [3336 bytes]
  /etc/secureboot/keys/PK/PK.auth [3334 bytes]
firmware keys:
  PK:
    /CN=SecureBoot PK
  KEK:
    /CN=SecureBoot KEK
  db:
    /CN=SecureBoot db

[...]
```

If it works, great ! You can now go back to your BIOS and enable the secure boot again.

But if like me your BIOS sucks (ASUS ðŸ‘€), it might not have worked and the keys are not there.

Before you try the following, put your BIOS into "setup mode" again.

You can try to run the following command:

```
sudo chattr -i /sys/firmware/efi/efivars/{PK,KEK,db}*
```

And then:

```
sudo sbkeysync --verbose --pk
```

To see if it helps. According to some issues on GitHub it worked for some, but not for me unfortunately.

The error I have and that you might have as well is the following:

```
Inserting key update /etc/secureboot/keys/KEK/KEK.auth into KEK
Error writing key update: Invalid argument
Error syncing keystore file /etc/secureboot/keys/KEK/KEK.auth
```

The `Invalid argument` part seems to indicate a firmware bug, but it's hard to know for sure.

In such cases, your last chance is to enroll keys manually into the BIOS.

Put the secure boot keys on your EFI partition like so:

```
sudo find /etc/secureboot -name '*.auth' -exec cp {} /efi \;
```

Go back to your BIOS and in the secure boot menu, enroll them and enable the secure boot.
Chances are, it should work now. You can confirm with `sudo sbkeysync --verbose`.

Don't forget to remove the keys from the EFI partition:

```
sudo shred -u /efi/db.auth /efi/KEK.auth /efi/PK.auth
```
