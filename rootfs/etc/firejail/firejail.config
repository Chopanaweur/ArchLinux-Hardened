# Disable /mnt, /media, /run/mount and /run/media access. By default access
# to these directories is enabled. Unlike --disable-mnt profile option this
# cannot be overridden by --noblacklist or --ignore.
disable-mnt yes

# Force use of nonewprivs.  This mitigates the possibility of
# a user abusing firejail's features to trick a privileged (suid
# or file capabilities) process into loading code or configuration
# that is partially under their control.  Default disabled.
force-nonewprivs yes

# If seccomp subsystem in Linux kernel kills a program, a message is posted to syslog.
# Starting with Linux kernel version 4.14, it is possible to send seccomp violation messages
# even if the program is allowed to continue (see "seccomp-error-action EPERM" above).
# This logging feature is disabled by default in our implementation.
